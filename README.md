# Lab01

This was the basics of C with 6 questions testing basic C programming


# Lab02

This was teaching us how to open `man 7 ip`, `man bind`, `man socket` etc. (Tutorial class)


# Lab03

Here we created a UDP communication. Used `sendto`, `recvfrom` APIs.


# Lab04

We extended the UDP with `htons`, `inet_aton()` for endianness..


# Lab05

We worked on TCP communication using the `send`, `accept`, `listen`, `recv` APIs.


# Lab06

We worked on a TCP chatserver i.e. multiple clients a single server. The server can choose who to send a message to or not.

# Lab07

Did FTP. Server does `ls` and sends this to the client. The client sends back which file they want to "download". The server "uploads" the contents of this file (just text) and sends it back to the client.
